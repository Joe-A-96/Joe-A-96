## 👋 Hey, My Name is Joseph (Joe)

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm someone who loves digging into data, building dashboards.
I’m always learning something new—whether it's leveling up my Python skills, trying out new visualization ideas.

I enjoy:
- Turning messy data into something meaningful  
- Building tools that make work easier  
- Learning new tech and improving my workflow  
- Sharing projects and experiments as I go  

If you're into data, dashboards  you're in the right place!
